# Laravel Vue Data Table

Fork of [Enso Vue Datatable](https://docs.laravel-enso.com/packages/vue-datatable.html)

Customized for my project needs. If you're using it feel free to let me know! I'd be 
happy to give this project a little more love. The primary reason for this fork was to 
reduce the dependencies needed. Original project requires nearly all of the Enso framework.

This version is also configured for **Bootstrap 4** as apposed to the original which is
 based off of _Bulma_.

### Configuration & Usage

Original docs should cover it, still need to pull over some information as they may not be in sync.

### Contributions

are welcome. Pull requests are great, but issues are good too.

### License

This package is released under the MIT license.
